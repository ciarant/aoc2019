2019 Advent of Code in Rust solutions
=====================================

Taking a lead from [BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi) I'm trying to learn a little Rust by taking on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Not sure how far into December I'll get.

To run a solution, `cd` into its directory and invoke the program with Cargo:

```
$ cd day01
$ cargo run --release < data/input.txt
```
